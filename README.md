Hi, I'm Callum Linnegan

This is my main repository, home to many of my assignments and projects.

I have completed a Bachelor of Science (applied mathematics) degree at Swinburne University. I had undertaken many applied statistics units as part of my degree which sparked my intest in data problems.

I am now undertaking a Data Analytics Certificate with Monash Univeristy to upskill and develop relevant technical skills for data analysis. Many of the repositories here are assignments, demonstrating my learning on a weekly basis.

The purpose of this account is to document my progress throughout my course.
