Hi, I'm Callum Linnegan

This is my main repository, home to many of my assignments and projects.

I have completed a Bachelor of Science (applied mathematics) degree at Swinburne University. I had undertaken many applied statistics units as part of my degree which sparked my intest in data problems.

I have recently completed a Data Analytics Bootcamp with Monash Univeristy to upskill and develop relevant technical skills for data analysis. Many of the repositories here are assignments, demonstrating my learning on a weekly basis. The bootcamp involved developing skills with programs such as Excel, Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to illustrate what is possible with data.

The purpose of this account is to document my progress throughout my course and the pinned repositories contain projects that I have contributed to throughout the bootcamp.
